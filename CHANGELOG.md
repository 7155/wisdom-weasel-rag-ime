# Changelog

Personal Agent Workbench follows a source-first development model. A public
source checkpoint is not a signed and notarized macOS binary release.

## 0.1.0-alpha.6 — 2026-09-10

- Enter the collaboration layout only through its explicit control. Show
  persistent background Bash and browser observers inside that layout;
  dismissing an observer leaves its tool running and resource completion closes it.
- Default conversation memory to off and add partner-specific memory, tool,
  plugin and Skill controls to Room composers. Honor explicit capability
  choices in Full Access; filter disabled packages before Pi imports them.
- Explain invalidated model credentials with account reconnection guidance,
  including failures retained in existing Room history.

## 0.1.0-alpha.5 — 2026-09-10

- Make Full Access execute tools without workspace path restrictions or
  per-action human/model approval, including existing Full Access Sessions.
  Keep stored policy identifiers compatible and report the effective policy
  consistently in the UI and Runtime prompt.

## 0.1.0-alpha.4 — 2026-09-10

- Make stellar cloud drift and planet movement visible while the desktop is
  exposed. Move crossfade layers together and retain pause/reduced-motion rules.
- Fill the Trace Agent window with its navigation and content, preserving
  compact navigation on narrow windows and scrolling for long reports.

## 0.1.0-alpha.3 — 2026-09-10

- Add an unsigned Apple Silicon offline DMG installer with a native installation
  window, bundled Python and Pi Runtime, payload verification and pre-update
  component backups. Reuse the stack installer without target-machine builds.
- Connect installed Electron voice settings to the existing Voice Agent for
  status, service controls, permission requests and credential configuration.
  Desktop voice status no longer waits on unrelated global runtime probes.

## 0.1.0-alpha.2 — 2026-09-10

Source preview; no signed or notarized macOS installer is included.

- Correct the installed app, Finder and pinned Dock name to Personal Agent
  Workbench. Preserve existing launch paths, bundle identity and user data;
  retain previous app bundles for local recovery.


- Give Room work, dispatch, cancellation and approval services explicit
  dependencies; preserve shared stores, event ordering and Runtime replacement.
- Separate Host transport from Session lifecycle, group Pi/Room sources by
  capability, and add typed construction boundaries and an offline Lab example.

- Retire the legacy Pi RPC executor and protocol selection. Shared configuration
  and factory code now construct only the protocol 2 Host; old transcript data
  remains readable, while protocol 1 packages cannot be built or activated.
- Name the current PAWOS React frontend React OS; keep existing product,
  Runtime and persisted layout identifiers compatible.
- Group Agent Lab backend modules under `rag_ime/agent_lab/` and place portable
  Agent controls with their shared Agent owner; update imports and export paths.
- Move supplied frontend reference archives and dated acceptance records into
  their owning directories, retaining original contents and attribution.

## 0.1.0-alpha.1 — 2026-09-07

First tagged PAW source preview. This release does not ship a signed or
notarized macOS installer.

### Highlights

- PAWOS desktop with persistent Agent Sessions, lightweight Rooms, tools,
  governed memory, document Knowledge, and Agent Lab.
- Generic Lab project materials, evaluation history, Knowledge workflows, and
  versioned Extension App preview/export.
- Shared Agent model selection, reasoning controls, progress and error recovery
  for embedded and exported App conversations; local PAW execution preserves
  the existing Pi Provider/OAuth boundary.
- Durable App request history, cancellation and reconnect without replaying an
  uncertain invocation; source-bound exports and document citations.
- Restored background cancellation and process-group cleanup on macOS Python
  3.12 with non-reaping child observation; retained protection against PID reuse.
- Gateway updates stop only their own stale listener, preserving isolated
  source candidates on other workspaces and ports.
- Rewritten project README and separate local-operation documentation; corrected
  Electron build path and current Pi compatibility reference.

### Earlier development changes included in this source preview

### Added

- Structured Agent Sessions and lightweight multi-Agent Rooms that compose
  ordinary Pi Sessions while retaining durable dispatch, cancellation, ordered
  public events, and terminal evidence.
- Capability-bound Tool disclosure, authorization, approval, execution, and
  terminal receipts.
- Protocol-owned Pi v1/v2 selection and an enforced public runtime contract.
- Paper-workspace Control Center UI with responsive Session and Room views.
- Local browser, voice, foreground-context, knowledge, planning, governed
  memory, backup, and restore boundaries.
- Separate public-source and distributable-binary readiness decisions.
- Governed coordinator background jobs include approval-bound launch, durable
  redacted cursor logs, lifecycle events, management APIs, cancellation, and
  Control Center controls. Focused validation, current-source browser preview,
  and installed backend-connected acceptance pass; installed native-app visual
  acceptance remains open.
- Session-local phased Todo tracking and Goal lifecycles, per-capability
  Tool/Skill disclosure, Session overrides, governed workspace operations,
  explicit LSP degradation, and active/archived Work Document flows share
  backend-owned contracts with Control Center projections. `todo` and
  `agent_goal` are discoverable through the managed Pi Tool catalog.
- Source support lets Room messages carry bounded, Room-owned clipboard or file
  images through authorized participant dispatch without exposing Session-private
  media; focused image-flow validation and same-snapshot installed acceptance
  remain open.

### Changed

- The public project identity is now Personal Agent Workbench; the default
  on-device companion is “澄.”
- Python 3.12 is the declared and tested minimum.
- Model selection is feature-owned: Agent/Room roles, Active RAG, and voice
  refinement use real runtime model catalogs instead of dead settings.
- The approval-gated Agent Plan lifecycle is retired. Migration `0135` converts
  active legacy rows to phased Todo events, renames causal receipts, and drops
  the old Plan tables; Todo records progress but never grants execution authority.
- HTTP route ownership is consolidated for ordinary families, with a
  fail-closed ratchet for deliberately special routes.
- Room-turn bookkeeping has one mutation owner.
- Pi v1 and v2 share explicit public projection/value contracts.
- Managed Rooms now use one Facilitator Session plus optional Partner Sessions;
  parallelism and independent review are selected only when useful, while the
  Facilitator integrates evidence and owns one final result.
- Core work guidance is now a conditional set of task Skills shared by
  standalone Sessions, Partners, and Tool Agents. The fixed
  execution/quality/review/handoff/archive pipeline is retired.
- The Control Center Room timeline now separates live reasoning, Tool activity,
  public participant reports, shared review, and the final reply in equal,
  responsive participant lanes with user-facing status language.
- Settled Room reports now show the linked runtime response's Provider, model,
  input/output/cache usage, and an exact Session-turn context-inspection action;
  missing telemetry is labeled unavailable instead of inferred.
- The Control Center Room Tasks view now leads with a responsive lifecycle
  graph from creation through participant work and execution to the shared
  result. Per-participant details remain available in a secondary disclosure;
  final-state rendering stays bound to the authoritative Root projection.
- Agent and Room prompts now keep the durable core, discovered Skills, working
  directory, and Tool schemas as a cache-stable prefix. Execution policy,
  query-aware recalled memory, workflow/lifecycle state, and current-turn context
  are ordered hidden runtime messages; recall refreshes only at Session start or
  after compaction instead of being rebuilt on every turn.
- Ask-style user questions now replace the ordinary Agent or Room composer with
  an in-place, responsive answer card; no modal masks the conversation, and the
  timeline reserves the card's measured height while the turn is waiting.
- Ordinary Agent Sessions now keep `ask` and `todo` as non-hideable base
  capabilities. Ask remains Pi-host-owned, Todo keeps the backend-owned
  lifecycle contract, and material user-owned choices route through the
  alignment-and-decision Skill before structured Ask UI is shown.
- The no-tools Provider cache Canary now accepts and records an explicit
  thinking level, so Luna Max cache evidence cannot silently run at a weaker
  reasoning setting.

### Fixed

- Agent approvals now retain their originating Tool-call identity and causal
  turn, so pending and fail-closed Luna decisions stay inside the owning task
  row instead of creating a duplicate timeline task.
- Exact failed Room Tool commands cannot loop under a new call ID without new
  successful Tool evidence.
- A terminal Tool invocation receipt cannot execute twice.
- Worktree-based audit paths resolve through Git's common directory.
- IME display feedback is deduplicated and stale fuzzy holdover is removed.
- Duplicate definitions, unreachable route branches, a live IME `NameError`,
  and response-contract enforcement gaps were repaired.
- Native Control Center Room creation and policy updates now forward governed
  execution fields instead of rejecting the Web contract at the bridge.
- Sealed Room maintenance now uses lightweight control-state fencing, preserves
  transcripts when reopening revoked nonresident Sessions, and treats repeated
  Tool-disclosure receipt timestamps as idempotent instead of blocking compaction.
- Ask answers now close only after a contiguous durable resolution event, and
  the Agent status rail consumes the current `workspace_lsp` capability
  projection instead of inferring readiness from historical Tool receipts.
- Room WorkItems now mirror canonical Kernel lifecycle changes and startup
  reconciliation; blocked work is no longer presented as actively executing.
- Room settlement now deduplicates review invitations, retries recoverable
  commits without losing accepted work, and reconciles transient resume lanes
  against the authoritative terminal Root.
- Final integration repair restored the Tool-matrix write receipt, current Room
  migration fixtures, DeepSeek memory-organizer transport, bounded runtime Tool
  manifests, and clarification routing through the dedicated Room Tool.
- Foreground verification now recognizes the AppKit assistant overlay as the
  authoritative post-commit surface, accepts current action-button badges,
  commits native Rime composition before assistant selection, and fails before
  clearing evidence when frontend tracing is disabled.
- Agent project headers now truly hide their conversation rows and preserve
  manual collapse across live Session-summary refreshes; wide desktop Agent
  workspaces open the renamed task center by default.
- Installed-product audit now recognizes the gateway-owned
  `memory-maintenance-trigger` marker at the memory-book maintenance component
  path instead of reporting a false overwritten-marker failure.
- Squirrel preparation now validates the capture-delivery-aware frontend trace
  gate, typechecks the durable input-capture outbox with its client, and uses a
  narrow cross-file delivery method instead of inaccessible private helpers.

### Validation

- `python3 -m unittest discover -s tests` passed 3,289 tests with three
  explicitly skipped cases in 1,429.139 seconds. The preceding audit's sole
  stale execution-policy wording assertion was repaired and the entire suite
  rerun. Existing unclosed-SQLite `ResourceWarning` output remains visible.
- Control Center passed 96 files / 813 tests and its production build. Full
  Playwright passed 160 cases with 35 intentional skips.
- Background jobs passed 235 focused backend lifecycle, Tool, HTTP route,
  projection, Session, and Room cancellation tests; the Control Center path
  passed 5 focused files / 188 tests and a production build. A current-source
  browser preview exercised list, cursor-log disclosure, and two-step cancel UI.
  An installed managed-Pi turn then loaded `workspace_job`, reached `running`
  after governed approval, returned cursor logs, cancelled the process group,
  persisted `cancelled`, and published started/progress/cancelled events.
  Installed native Control Center visual acceptance remains open.
- The Room task-flow source passed 26 focused preview/control tests and
  TypeScript checks. Browser inspection at 1440×1000 and 430×900 verified two
  task/dispatch paths, stage order, detail disclosure, and no graph overflow.
  This proof used the current-source preview transport, not an installed app.
- Import boundaries passed. Route ownership passed with 91 dispatched routes,
  203 declared routes, and 40/40 undeclared-route checks. All 156 generated
  Control Center contracts reproduced without drift.
- The current managed Pi payload passed protocol-v2, OAuth, and Runtime hello
  smoke checks, then installed and activated as the current verified generation.
- A real TextEdit/Squirrel run produced 84 privacy-safe AppKit events and passed
  native Rime composition, post-commit overlay visibility, source badges,
  Option+number assistant selection, commit, and follow-up checks. The focused
  foreground analyzer suite passes 79 tests.
- The repository-only release audit remains blocked by the dirty worktree and a
  pre-existing OpenAI-key-shaped test fixture at
  `tests/test_historical_memory_curation.py:275`; it also reports pending
  tracked-file deletions. Distribution remains blocked by foreground acceptance,
  the declared blocked status, and the missing release manifest.

### Known Distribution Gates

- Fresh installed foreground acceptance for Squirrel, Accessibility, and voice.
- Candidate-quality sign-off for the configured local model.
- Developer ID signing, notarization, stapling, clean-machine installation, and
  a hash-verified `rag-ime.release-manifest.v2`.
