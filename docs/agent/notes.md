# Notes

## Run prefs (persistent)

- Do not maintain the learnA study site while implementing this product repo.
- Keep production macOS input method work on the Rime/Squirrel route; the InputMethodKit app is a prototype/debug harness.

Problem:
- Squirrel side candidates could be inserted, but the first patch did not write accepted RAG choices back to the memory core.
- `max_side_candidates` could be exceeded when model and RAG candidates both filled visible slots.

Findings:
- Wisdom-Weasel's useful pattern is async prediction with request sequence invalidation, frontend-side candidate merge, and custom selection routing for appended model candidates.
- The Squirrel patch should keep librime unchanged and route side candidates by display metadata in `SquirrelInputController`.

Changes:
- Added `sourceEventId` to `displayCandidates`.
- Updated the Squirrel patch to record side candidate commits and `action-json accepted` for RAG memory candidates.
- Fixed global side-candidate cap across model and RAG candidates.

Commands:
- `python3 -W ignore::ResourceWarning -m unittest discover -s tests`
- `python3 -m rag_ime.cli --core-mode fixture acceptance`
- `scripts/build_macos_frontend.sh`
- `RagImeMac --preview-rime-sidecar-json`
- `git apply --check squirrel-patches/0001-add-rag-ime-sidecar.patch`

Next:
- Build and install a patched Squirrel app in a full Xcode environment.
- Replace per-request Python process spawning with a long-lived daemon or local socket.
